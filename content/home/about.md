# What we do

The marine environment is a complex and diverse system, involving multiple interactions between aquatic, atmospheric and terrestrial elements. These interactions span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, making the study of this fascinating environment a highly interdisciplinary challenge. CROSSMAR lab focuses on one of the most critical aspects of this challenge: understanding the role of ocean circulation in controlling marine systems and regulating key interactions between their components.

The approach we take is based on integrating theoretical work with acquisition, processing, analysis and interpretation of (i) in-situ data and (ii) remote sensing data from satellites and from small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS). This multi-platform approach allows coverage of a variety of interactions over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, thus contributing to our ability to understand, monitor and protect the marine environment.
